== [[LogicalPlan]] LogicalPlan Contract -- Logical Relational Operator with Children and Expressions / Logical Query Plan

`LogicalPlan` is an extension of the <<spark-sql-catalyst-QueryPlan.adoc#, QueryPlan contract>> for <<implementations, logical operators>> to build a *logical query plan* (i.e. a tree of logical operators).

`LogicalPlan` can be <<analyzed, analyzed>> and <<resolved, resolved>>.

In order to get the <<spark-sql-QueryExecution.adoc#logical, logical plan>> of a structured query you should use the <<spark-sql-Dataset.adoc#queryExecution, QueryExecution>>.

[source, scala]
----
val q: DataFrame = ...
val plan = q.queryExecution.logical
----

NOTE: A logical query plan is a tree of link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc[nodes] of logical operators with their own trees of expressions. In other words, there are _at least_ two trees at every level (operator).

[[analyzed]]
`LogicalPlan` can be *analyzed* which is to say that the plan (including children) has gone through analysis and verification.

[source, scala]
----
scala> plan.analyzed
res1: Boolean = true
----

[[logical-plan-to-be-analyzed-idiom]]
[NOTE]
====
A common idiom in Spark SQL to make sure that a logical plan can be analyzed is to request a `SparkSession` for the <<spark-sql-SparkSession.adoc#sessionState, SessionState>> that is in turn requested to <<spark-sql-SessionState.adoc#executePlan, "execute">> the logical plan (which simply creates a <<spark-sql-QueryExecution.adoc#creating-instance, QueryExecution>>).

[source, scala]
----
val qe = sparkSession.sessionState.executePlan(child)
qe.assertAnalyzed()
val analyzedPlan = qe.analyzed
----
====

[[childrenResolved]]
A logical operator is considered *partially resolved* when its link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc#children[child operators] are resolved (aka _children resolved_).

[[resolved]]
A logical operator is (fully) *resolved* to a specific schema when all link:spark-sql-catalyst-QueryPlan.adoc#expressions[expressions] and the <<childrenResolved, children are resolved>>.

[source, scala]
----
scala> plan.resolved
res2: Boolean = true
----

A logical plan knows the size of objects that are results of query operators, like `join`, through `Statistics` object.

[source, scala]
----
scala> val stats = plan.statistics
stats: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.Statistics = Statistics(8,false)
----

[[maxRows]]
A logical plan knows the maximum number of records it can compute.

[source, scala]
----
scala> val maxRows = plan.maxRows
maxRows: Option[Long] = None
----

`LogicalPlan` can be <<isStreaming, streaming>> if it contains one or more link:spark-sql-streaming-source.adoc[structured streaming sources].

NOTE: `LogicalPlan` is in the end transformed to a link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[physical query plan].

| [[statsCache]] `statsCache`
| Cached plan statistics (as `Statistics`) of the `LogicalPlan`

Computed and cached in <<stats, stats>>.

Used in <<stats, stats>> and <<verboseStringWithSuffix, verboseStringWithSuffix>>.

Reset in <<invalidateStatsCache, invalidateStatsCache>>
|===

=== [[stats]] Getting Cached or Calculating Estimated Statistics -- `stats` Method

[source, scala]
----
stats(conf: CatalystConf): Statistics
----

`stats` returns the <<statsCache, cached plan statistics>> or <<computeStats, computes a new one>> (and caches it as <<statsCache, statsCache>>).

[NOTE]
====
`stats` is used when:

* A `LogicalPlan` <<computeStats, computes `Statistics`>>
* `QueryExecution` link:spark-sql-QueryExecution.adoc#completeString[builds complete text representation]
* `JoinSelection` link:spark-sql-SparkStrategy-JoinSelection.adoc#canBroadcast[checks whether a plan can be broadcast] et al
* link:spark-sql-Optimizer-CostBasedJoinReorder.adoc[CostBasedJoinReorder] attempts to reorder inner joins
* `LimitPushDown` is link:spark-sql-Optimizer-LimitPushDown.adoc#apply[executed] (for link:spark-sql-joins.adoc#FullOuter[FullOuter] join)
* `AggregateEstimation` estimates `Statistics`
* `FilterEstimation` estimates child `Statistics`
* `InnerOuterEstimation` estimates `Statistics` of the left and right sides of a join
* `LeftSemiAntiEstimation` estimates `Statistics`
* `ProjectEstimation` estimates `Statistics`

=== [[invalidateStatsCache]] `invalidateStatsCache` method

=== [[isStreaming]] Is Logical Plan Streaming? -- `isStreaming` method

[source, scala]
----
isStreaming: Boolean
----

`isStreaming` is part of the public API of `LogicalPlan` and is enabled (i.e. `true`) when a logical plan is a link:spark-sql-streaming-source.adoc[streaming source].

By default, it walks over subtrees and calls itself, i.e. `isStreaming`, on every child node to find a streaming source.

[source, scala]
----
val spark: SparkSession = ...

// Regular dataset
scala> val ints = spark.createDataset(0 to 9)
ints: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[Int] = [value: int]

scala> ints.queryExecution.logical.isStreaming
res1: Boolean = false

// Streaming dataset
scala> val logs = spark.readStream.format("text").load("logs/*.out")
logs: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [value: string]

scala> logs.queryExecution.logical.isStreaming
res2: Boolean = true
----

NOTE: Streaming Datasets are part of Structured Streaming.

=== [[refresh]] Refreshing Child Logical Plans -- `refresh` Method

[source, scala]
----
refresh(): Unit
----

`refresh` calls itself recursively for every link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc#children[child] logical operator.

NOTE: `refresh` is overriden by link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan-LogicalRelation.adoc#refresh[LogicalRelation] only (that refreshes the location of `HadoopFsRelation` relations only).

[NOTE]
====
`refresh` is used when:

* `SessionCatalog` is requested to link:spark-sql-SessionCatalog.adoc#refreshTable[refresh a table]

* `CatalogImpl` is requested to link:spark-sql-CatalogImpl.adoc#refreshTable[refresh a table]
