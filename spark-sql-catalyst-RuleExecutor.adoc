== [[RuleExecutor]] RuleExecutor -- Tree Transformation Rule Executor

`RuleExecutor` <<execute, executes>> a <<batches, collection of batches of rules>> to transform a link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc[TreeNode].

NOTE: Available `TreeNodes` are eithe link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical] or link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[physical] operators.

`RuleExecutor` defines the protected `batches` method that implementations are supposed to define with the collection of <<batch, Batch>> instances to <<execute, execute>>.

=== [[execute]] Applying Rules to Tree -- `execute` Method

[source, scala]
----
execute(plan: TreeType): TreeType
----

`execute` iterates over <<batch, batches>> and applies rules sequentially to the input `plan`.

It tracks the number of iterations and the time of executing each rule (with a plan).

When a rule changes a plan, you should see the following TRACE message in the logs:

```
TRACE HiveSessionStateBuilder$$anon$1:
=== Applying Rule [ruleName] ===
[currentAndModifiedPlansSideBySide]
```

After the number of iterations has reached the number of iterations for the batch's `Strategy` it stops execution and prints out the following WARN message to the logs:

```
WARN HiveSessionStateBuilder$$anon$1: Max iterations ([iteration]) reached for batch [batchName]
```

When the plan has not changed (after applying rules), you should see the following TRACE message in the logs and `execute` moves on to applying the rules in the next batch. The moment is called *fixed point* (i.e. when the execution *converges*).

```
TRACE HiveSessionStateBuilder$$anon$1: Fixed point reached for batch [batchName] after [iteration] iterations.
```

After the batch finishes, if the plan has been changed by the rules, you should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG HiveSessionStateBuilder$$anon$1:
=== Result of Batch [batchName] ===
[currentAndModifiedPlansSideBySide]
```

Otherwise, when the rules had no changes to a plan, you should see the following TRACE message in the logs:

```
TRACE HiveSessionStateBuilder$$anon$1: Batch [batchName] has no effect.
```

=== [[batch]][[Batch]] Batch -- Collection of Rules

Catalyst `Batch` is a named collection of link:spark-sql-catalyst-Rule.adoc[rules] with a strategy, e.g.

[source, scala]
----
Batch("Substitution", fixedPoint,
  CTESubstitution,
  WindowsSubstitution,
  EliminateUnions,
  new SubstituteUnresolvedOrdinals(conf)),
----

A `Strategy` can be `Once` or `FixedPoint` (with a number of iterations).

NOTE: `Once` strategy is a `FixedPoint` strategy with one iteration.
