== [[Rule]] Catalyst Rule

`Rule` is a <<ruleName, named>> transformation that can be <<apply, applied>> to (i.e. _executed on_) a link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc[TreeNode].

[[TreeType]]
NOTE: `TreeNode` can either be a link:spark-sql-Expression.adoc[Catalyst expression] or a link:spark-sql-catalyst-QueryPlan.adoc[query plan] (i.e. concrete link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical] or link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[physical] plans).

[[apply]]
[source, scala]
----
apply(plan: TreeType): TreeType
----

NOTE: <<TreeType, TreeType>> is the type of a tree that a `Rule` operates on, e.g. link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[LogicalPlan], link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[SparkPlan] or link:spark-sql-Expression.adoc[Expression].

[[ruleName]]
`Rule` has the rule name (that is simply a class name).
