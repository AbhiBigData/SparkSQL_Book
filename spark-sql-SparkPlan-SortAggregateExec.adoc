CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[doExecute]] Executing SortAggregateExec (Generating RDD Of Internal Rows) -- `doExecute` Method

[source, scala]
----
doExecute(): RDD[InternalRow]
----

NOTE: `doExecute` is part of link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc#doExecute[SparkPlan Contract] to describe a distributed computation as an `RDD` of link:spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc[internal rows] that is the runtime representation of a structured query (aka _execute_).

`doExecute`...FIXME
